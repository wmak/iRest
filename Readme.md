Couldn't find a library that did this exactly how I wanted to.
Remove references to pync if you don't want to run this on a mac.

## Installation
- Install Terminal-Notifier: https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier
- Install espeak: probably `brew install espeak` or `sudo apt-get install espeak`

## TODO
- Get some proper voice files so it's not the creepy espeak voice.
